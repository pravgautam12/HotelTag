Ever had a junction box that you had multiple electrical connectors on and had to use 3 different junction boxes with 3 different home runs to show three different circuits. Well, forget about that. This program solves that completely. Using the Comments parameter, it updates the value of that parameter to whatever circuit number you just added manually when you powered up your first electrical connector in that junction box. It keeps on updating that parameter value based on circuit numbers of those connectors. That means everything is smart, as is supposed to be in Revit. 

Using a tag that references the comments parameter, a smart way of showing circuit numbers is achieved that saves a ton of time. It also searches through the document and adds circuit tags for the junction box (based on how many electrical connectors are circuited) if the tag has not been placed already. 

Cheers!
